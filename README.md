# KOTLIN Bubble Sort Project

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted. While Bubble Sort is easy to understand and implement, it is not the most efficient sorting algorithm, especially for larger lists. Its average and worst-case time complexity is O(n^2), where 'n' is the number of elements in the list. This makes it less suitable for large datasets compared to more efficient sorting algorithms like Merge Sort, Quick Sort, or even the built-in sorting functions provided by programming languages.
